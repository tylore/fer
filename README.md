##GitHub Push Protocol

NOTE: Anything listed with quotes and italics i.e "*branch name*" means you have to replace that text with the nouns from the Ruby project. 

1. git checkout "*branch name*"
2. git add -A
3. git commit -m "*make edits*"
4. git push "*branch name*"
5. find repo on github website and create a pull request. (Team will confirm pull request.)
6. git checkout master 
7. git pull 
8. view edits from branch added to local master.
